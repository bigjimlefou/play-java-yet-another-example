This project is a Java Play Framework cherry picked base of modules/libs/examples to quickly start a new project.

It will demonstrate the use of play features :

    https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ThreadPools
    https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaAsync
    https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaForms
    
Use some play modules :

    https://github.com/pac4j/play-pac4j
    https://adrianhurt.github.io/play-bootstrap/
    https://github.com/iheartradio/play-swagger
    
Embrace Adlmin LTE Template as much as possible :
  
    https://adminlte.io/themes/dev/AdminLTE/index.html
    
And probably a lot of other libs that will be listed later ...

This is not a "Best Practice" but contains some good recipes to start a project with its first requirements
